### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - The script imports necessary modules for creating interactive graphics (`ipycanvas`), handling widgets (`ipywidgets`), and managing command-line arguments (`sys`).

2. **TowerOfHanoiSolver Function**:
   - This function solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle recursively and returns the sequence of moves.

3. **tripleDraw Class**:
   - This class is responsible for drawing the towers and disks using `ipycanvas`.
   - The `__init__` method initializes the canvas and sets up dimensions and colors.
   - The `predraw` method sets up the static parts of the drawing (bases and towers).
   - The `draw` method updates the canvas to reflect the current state of the disks on the towers.

4. **play_hanoi Function**:
   - This function manages the gameplay, allowing the user to step through the solution one move at a time.
   - It uses widgets (`IntText` for input and `Button` for interaction) to control the game.
   - The `next_hanoi` generator function `yield`s moves and updates the display accordingly.

5. **Main Execution**:
   - The script checks command-line arguments to determine the number of disks and starts the game with default tower labels ("A", "B", "C") if no arguments are provided.

This script provides an interactive, graphical way to understand the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using `ipycanvas` for visualization.
